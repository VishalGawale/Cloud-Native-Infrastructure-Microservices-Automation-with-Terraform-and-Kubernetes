# Cloud-Native Infrastructure & Microservices Automation with Terraform and Kubernetes

## What is this project about?
This project shows how to set up a **cloud-native system** using **Terraform** and **Kubernetes**. It automates the creation of infrastructure (like servers and networks) and deploys microservices (small, independent app pieces) to make everything run smoothly in the cloud.

## Why I made this
I wanted to learn and share how to:
- Use Terraform to build infrastructure fast.
- Use Kubernetes to manage microservices.
- Make systems that are scalable and easy to update.

## Whatâ€™s inside?
- **Terraform files**: Code to create cloud resources (e.g., servers, networks).
- **Kubernetes configs**: Files to set up and run microservices.
- Maybe some scripts or examples (add what fits your project!).

## How to use it
1. Install Terraform and Kubernetes on your computer.
2. Clone this project from GitHub: https://github.com/VishalGawale/Cloud-Native-Infrastructure-Microservices-Automation-with-Terraform-and-Kubernetes.git
3. Run Terraform to build the infrastructure:
   terraform init
   terraform apply

4. Set up Kubernetes (add simple steps if you have them).

## Tools I used
- **Terraform**: For building the infrastructure.
- **Kubernetes**: For managing microservices.
- (Add any other tools like Docker, AWS, etc., if you used them.)

## Next steps
- Add more microservices.
- Test it on different clouds (like AWS, Google Cloud).
- Improve automation with scripts.
